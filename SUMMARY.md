This is a kotlin application which fullfils the requirements mentioned in the assignment.The requirements were clear.

Which part of the assignment took the most time and why?

Kotlin is totally new to me. I am experienced Java developer. I took it as a challenge to develop application in kotlin by following best practses. I was occupied with my official work but happy to complete this task in given time frame. 
I have added most of the validations like empty file, max size etc. And in case of any violation, API returns meaningful error message. The application is dockerized.
